Robert contacted the 77th Precinct Community Affairs Unit and solicited their involvement in cleaning up the area. The then head of the Community Affairs Unit, Sgt. Bullion, assigned P.O. Robert Manvella. Officer Manvella worked extremely hard along with community residents to keep the lot clean and to remove drug dealers from its corners. It was not an easy task, but with the help of the Community Board and the 77th Precinct, the community was gradually able to decrease the drug activity taking place near the lot. A gazebo was erected in the garden with the assistance of Officer Manvella, and grass and flowers were planted. In 2002, the garden began operating as an independent nonprofit organization, with the assistance of the Trust for Public Land, and was then transferred to BQLT.

","Woodbine Street Block Assoc. Garden
",Gardens,"Brooklyn Queens Land Trust member garden - Woodbine Street Block Association Garden was founded in 1979 by neighbors adamant about maintaining civility in a time of upheaval. Following the New York City blackout of 1977, the city left their block torn apart and streets virtually impassable for nearly three years. Neighbors had to fight for streetlights and for trees to be planted. Built on the ashes of two homes that were burned to the ground, the garden was quickly filled with beds of strawberries, collard greens, and peppers. The current crop of gardeners wish to thank the Block Association and garden elders for the opportunity to restore this garden to its former glory and to let it serve as a beautiful beacon of hope for the neighborhood.","146 Woodbine Street, Brookyln, Bushwick, NY 11221",Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Woodbine-Street-Block-Association-Garden-112445888847576/,,,,,,,,,-73.91644,40.69256

It was a dumping ground for old appliances, tires and abandoned cars. It was a warzone when Abu, his son Bobby Watson and a handful of community members took on the challenge. Today Taqwa yields about 10,000 pounds of food annually and a colony of bees and a dozen chickens call the farm home. “Just get a few chickens and you can feed yourself,” says Abu. After two decades of hard work, fruiting pear, apple and cherry trees are found with collard greens, lettuce, onions and bushes of strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. To look at Taqwa Community Farm today, you couldn’t imagine what it was 20 years ago.","90 W 164th Street Bronx, NY",https://www.instagram.com/taqwacommunityfarm/?hl=en,,,,,,,,,-73.929093,40.832657

In 1986, this land was an abandoned city owned lot inhabited by rats and strewn with refuse. The garden was born thanks to the efforts of Mary and Angel Aponte, a neighborhood couple, who cleared out the garbage. Green Guerrillas gave a lot of assistance to the Apontes in the beginning. In addition, they received many letters and petitions of support from the community board, the Church and other local community groups.

Today, the Brises del Caribe Garden is a beautiful spot covered with trees and various plants such as tomatoes, roses, and morning glories. Many birds make their homes there, and the garden also features a pool with goldfish. The members, most of whom are Hispanic people from the immediate neighborhood, have invested a great deal of time, effort and love into the garden. Angel Aponte personally built and maintains the two wooden cabanas where people gather when the weather is cool and rainy. The garden is the center of social life for its members. Many cultural and educational programs take place here, such as family reunions, parties and other informal get-togethers. Neighborhood children visit with their school classes; attendees from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe located across the street frequently stop by late into the evening.

El Sol Brillante is one of its crown jewels and with new membership (including the children and grandchildren of its original founders), a robust bokashi composting education center with classes/demonstrations for the local schools, and continuous capital improvements funded through two community festivals held annually in June and October, El Sol Brillante will continue to be a vital asset to this historical neighborhood.","522-528 East 12th Street, Manhattan, NY, 10009",https://elsolbrillante.org/,,,,,,,,,-73.980361,40.728408

When Carolyn Schaefer moved to E 129th Street, she grew tired of looking out onto an empty, derelict lot. She seized the opportunity to reclaim it for everyone to enjoy and preserve it for the community. She started holding meetings with neighbors in 2002 and they worked tirelessly with the NYC Parks Dept, GreenThumb & Green Gorillas so that it would not fall in the hands of developers. Phil Gaetano made her vision come true by donating his expertise as a landscaper, his labor and materials. All the plants, trees, and flowers you see in the garden have been planted since 2003, except for 4 trees along the west fence. Carolyn passed away in July of 2015, but she left us a gift that we now are entrusted to carry forward for her. A memorial was held in the garden the following summer at which time the garden was renamed in her memory.","8 East 129th Street, Manhattan, NY",https://www.harlemrosegarden.nyc/,,,,,,,,,-73.939948,40.808556

261,a2bfdb,La Plaza Cultural de Armando Perez Community Garden,La Plaza Cultural de Armando Perez Community Garden,Gardens,"GreenThumb garden - La Plaza Cultural de Armando Perez Community Garden was founded in 1976 by local residents and greening activists who took over what was then a series of vacant city lots piled high with rubble and trash. In an effort to improve the neighborhood during a downward trend of arson, drugs, and abandonment common in that era, members of the Latino group CHARAS cleared out truckloads of refuse. Working with Buckminster Fuller, they built a geodesic dome in the open “plaza” and began staging cultural events. Green Guerillas pioneer Liz Christy seeded the turf with “seed bombs” and planted towering weeping willows and linden trees. Artist Gordon Matta-Clark helped construct La Plaza’s amphitheater using railroad ties and materials reclaimed from abandoned buildings.

Later, block residents tilled the western portion of the space and planted vegetables, flowers, and fruit trees. During the 1980s, the garden came under attack by developers seeking to build on the space. After numerous court battles, La Plaza was finally preserved in 2002 as part of the terms of a legal settlement.

In 2003, La Plaza was renamed in memory of Armando Perez, a CHARAS founder and former District Leader of the Lower East Side who was killed in 1999.","674 East 9th Street, Manhattan, NY, 10009","https://laplazacultural.com/

Overview: LaGuardia Corner Gardens is an award-winning community garden in the heart of NYC’s Greenwich Village. It is a place of natural beauty, where the visitor can find an oasis of calm in urban surroundings. During the growing season visitors can enjoy a dazzling display of daffodils, tulips, irises, peonies, roses, and other perennials, as well as shrubs and fruit trees.

The garden was created in 1981 by volunteers on a strip of barren land. It is maintained and supported by volunteer members. LCG is registered with NYC’s GreenThumb and is a designated Backyard Wildlife Habitat and Monarch Way Station. The garden has trees, shrubs, and perennials that attract birds, butterflies, and bees.

263,7e73d5,Le Petit Versailles Garden,Le Petit Versailles Garden,Gardens,"GreenThumb garden - This 20‘ by 60′ garden with entrances on both Houston Street and Second Street was created by Peter Cramer and Jack Waters on the site of a former ""chop shop.” It is appropriate that a stage dominates the garden because the gardeners are committed to providing a space for performers, filmmakers, and visual artists to show their work. A narrow brick path slopes down from the Houston Street entrance and splits to circle the low wooden platform that serves as a stage. Narrow beds filled with shrubs, perennials. vines, and annuals border the walls of the adjacent buildings. The path continues under a vine-draped arch, through an arbor covered seating area, to the gate on Second Street. Le Petit Versailles is a project of Allied Productions, a not-for- profit arts organization, and has an active performance and exhibit schedule during the summer months.","247 E. 2nd Street, Manhattan, NY, 10009","Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lpvgarden/?hl=en

269,fcb525,Lucille McClarey Wicked Friendship Garden,Lucille McClarey Wicked Friendship Garden,Gardens,"NY Restoration Project garden - The Lucille McClarey Wicked Friendship Garden began over 30 years ago when block activist, Mrs. Lucille McClarey, got neighbors together to clear out an abandoned lot and rented it from the city for $1 a year. She loved and tended to the Garden until she passed in the late 1990s. In the late 90s and early 2000 the city began to talk of taking the land back. New York Restoration Project purchased the land with the intention to keep the garden intact and give it back to the community to enjoy.

In 2007, as part of their Green for Good campaign, the smash Broadway production of Wicked provided funding to renovate the Friendship Garden with a wildly imaginative and fantastical design provided by the show’s Associate Scenic Designer, Edward Pierce. Echoing themes of the Land of Oz – and as portrayed in the Broadway production – the Friendship Garden features unique Oz-inspired lampposts and fencing, a poppy-painted mural, a ""yellow brick"" path, an ""emerald"" granite patio, a spiral-twisted stone barbeque and two new street trees in front of the space. The revitalized garden is also lush with plant life – including a variety of roses, lilies, hostas and hydrangeas. Finally, a wishing well – located in the middle of the garden – symbolizes that a community working together, as one, can truly make any wish come true.","499 West 150th Street, Manhattan, NY","http://www.west150nyc.com/garden.html

The garden consists of a few private beds for old time residents and 750 square feet of communal growing space cultivated and cared for by members and volunteers. We also have compost bins for food scrap drop offs and process hundreds of pounds of food scraps each month.

During the growing season we offer an affordable CSA program that includes freshly harvested produce and local eggs sourced from Grow NYC. Over the years our space has been utilized by educators and organizers like NYC’s Green Guerillas youth internship program and the Free Black Woman’s Library, and our gates are open daily for the community to enjoy.","462-466 Halsey Street, Brooklyn, NY","https://www.instagram.com/462halsey/?hl=en

Since March 2010 Prospect Farm has been a community project development toward producing healthy local food as an alternative to industrial food. Our objective is diversity in food production and membership. We are slowly creating healthy soil through our community composting project and farm without chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. Prospect Farm is a community association with membership open to all. Members improve and farm the land and sustain ties with local residents, businesses and organizations. We support the Brooklyn Food Coalition and other initiatives for food sovereignty and food justice.","1194 Prospect Avenue, Brooklyn, NY",https://prospectfarm.org/,,,,,,,,,-73.976458,40.654038

507,ba83da,Kelly Street Garden,Kelly Street Garden,Gardens,"The core mission of the Kelly St. garden is to provide healthy food to local residents free of charge. Sharing healthy food with an impacted, vulnerable community is easier said than done. It requires an educational component. It is a process of informing the community by introducing new options. The most receptive to these options are often young people. It is not only about education, but about creating a space where the stressors of the community can be left at the door, and light cast on the healing components of food, culture, and the opportunity to improve mind and body.

At the center of KSG is the essential idea of creating a green, healing space that not only encourages wellness through the participation in the growing food, but also understanding how putting our hands in the soil brings a sense of calm and release from the daily stresses of modern life. We encourage our gardeners and residents to take on projects of their own that correspond to the work of the garden with minimal supervision..","924 Kelly St, The Bronx, NY 10459",https://www.kellystreetgarden.org/about-the-garden,,,,,,,,,-73.897495,40.81879
